# Monetization Strategy: Denominator is Worthless

## 1. Freemium SaaS (Easiest to Start)

### Free Tier
- 10 calculations/day
- Basic items only (crypto + knowledge base)
- No AI price estimation
- Watermarked results

### Pro ($9/month)
- Unlimited calculations
- AI price estimation for ANY item
- Historical price charts
- Export data (CSV, PDF)
- API access (1000 calls/month)

### Business ($49/month)
- Everything in Pro
- White-label embed widget
- Bulk calculations (upload spreadsheet)
- Priority support
- Custom integrations

**Revenue estimate**: 1000 users × $9 = $9K MRR

---

## 2. Transaction Fees (High Potential)

When users want to actually EXECUTE trades:

### Verified Trade Escrow
- User A has Bitcoin, User B has Tesla
- Platform holds items in escrow
- Releases when both confirm
- **Fee: 2-5% of trade value**

### P2P Marketplace
- List items for barter
- Matchmaking algorithm
- Secure exchange protocol
- **Fee: 3% per completed trade**

**Revenue estimate**: $100K trades/day × 3% = $3K/day = $90K/month

---

## 3. API-as-a-Service (B2B)

Sell access to valuation engine:

```javascript
// Developer API
POST /api/valuate
Headers: { "X-API-Key": "your_key" }
Pricing:
- Free: 100 calls/day
- Startup ($29/mo): 10K calls/day  
- Business ($199/mo): 100K calls/day
- Enterprise ($999/mo): Unlimited + SLA
```

**Target customers:**
- Pawn shops (automated valuations)
- Estate sale companies
- Barter exchanges
- Insurance companies (claim valuations)
- E-commerce platforms

**Revenue estimate**: 50 business customers × $200 = $10K MRR

---

## 4. Affiliate Commissions (Passive)

When users search for items, show "Buy Now" links:

| Platform | Commission |
|----------|-----------|
| Amazon | 1-10% |
| eBay | 50-70% of fees |
| StockX (sneakers) | 3% |
| OpenSea (NFTs) | 2.5% |
| Coinbase (crypto) | $10-50 per trade |

**Example:** User searches "Jordan 1s" → Show StockX link → User buys → You get 3%

**Revenue estimate**: 10K clicks/day × 2% conversion × $200 avg × 3% = $1.2K/day

---

- Pay for AI calculations (cheaper than fiat)
- Governance (vote on new features)
- Revenue share (token holders get % of fees)

### Tokenomics
- Total supply: 1B tokens
